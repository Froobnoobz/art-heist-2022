      <p>
        Agent, you're our last hope to crack the code and retrieve the Mona Yanir, we've all been caught, and you're our last shot
        <br /><br />
        Each of our agents who have been caught have left their individual clues as a fail safe around the casino.
        <br /><br />
        We have an inside woman (Pauline) who you can make contact with who knows the location of the clues, but it'll cost you.
        Solve her twisted games or pay a modest price to acquire the location. She will only give you 2 clues though, so keeps your wits sharp.
        <br /><br />
        If you manage to find them all, crack the clue and find the password to crack the Mona Yanir vault.
      </p>

      Here are the clues agent. Our agents have left a unique calling card at each drop point, you'll recognise it by the distinct mask, accompinied by a singular letter.
